# 🛠️ Development Log – 2025-07-17

## 🎯 Goal
Connect all user balances (fixed income, investments, and trading) to Firebase and make them persistent.

## ✅ Tasks Completed
- [x] Connected `HomeScreen` to Firestore: reads user balances
- [x] `RentaFijaScreen`: shows and resets earnings from Firestore
- [x] `InversionesScreen`: allows creating/closing investments, saves to Firestore
- [x] `TradingScreen`: validates portfolio proportions before access

## 🧹 Fixes
- Resolved error: `useState of null` by moving hooks inside component
- Fixed navigation type error (`'Inicio' is not assignable to parameter of type 'never'`)
- Cleaned and secured `package.json`
- Upgraded Expo SDK and dependencies

## 🔐 Security Improvements
- Created `.env` for Firebase keys
- Configured `react-native-dotenv`
- Prevented sensitive data from being committed to GitHub

## 📌 Decisions
- Firebase is used as the single source of truth
- All screens now use real-time data from Firestore
