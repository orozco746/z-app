# 🛠️ Development Log – 2025-07-21

## 🎯 Goal
Enhance user identity and profile structure in Firebase, and reflect it visually in the app.

## ✅ Tasks Completed
- [x] Added `displayName`, `photoURL`, `score`, and `rank` fields to Firestore user documents
- [x] Modified `LoginScreen` to create/update user profile in Firestore after login
- [x] Updated `HomeScreen` to display user profile info (avatar, name, rank, score)
- [x] Synced Firestore data with TypeScript `UserData` interface
- [x] Customized `UserData` type to match Firestore structure exactly

## 🧹 Fixes
- Added missing styles in `HomeScreen` to avoid `avatar`, `username`, and `info` errors
- Removed outdated fields from `UserData` and renamed `nivel` → `rank`
- Corrected type error: `'photoURL' does not exist on type 'UserData'`

## 🔐 Security Improvements
- Validated document creation to use `merge: true` to preserve existing data
- Ensured `serverTimestamp()` is used for `createdAt` and `updatedAt`

## 📌 Decisions
- `rank` will serve as user level (no separate `nivel` field)
- Firestore documents under `usuarios/{uid}` serve as the central profile records
