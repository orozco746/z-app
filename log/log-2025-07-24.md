# 📆 Development Log – 2025-07-24

## 🎯 **Main Objective**
Integrate `Firebase Auth` using Firebase v11+ with `React Native` and `Expo`, including session management with an initial user balance and secure configuration.

## ✅ **Tasks Completed**
- [x] Created and configured `AuthContext` to manage global authentication state.
- [x] Updated `LoginScreen.tsx` to register users in Firebase with a Firestore document and an initial balance of 100,000.
- [x] Ensured that registration or login automatically redirects based on session state.
- [x] Added conditional navigation protection in `App.tsx`.
- [x] Fixed the navigation error `"Inicio" not assignable to parameter of type 'never'"`.

## ⚠️ **Warnings and Pending Issues**
- ⚠️ Firebase warning:  
  `Auth (11.10.0): You are initializing Firebase Auth for React Native without providing AsyncStorage`.  
  This is because **Expo Go does not support `initializeAuth`**. It is recommended to address this once the app is built with `EAS Build`.

- ❌ Persistent error:  
  `The 'navigation' object hasn't been initialized yet`  
  Appears when redirecting too early (before `NavigationContainer` is mounted). It is recommended to manage navigation within the rendered tree in `AppNavigation`.

## 🔒 **Security and Cleanup**
- `.env` contains sensitive Firebase keys and has been excluded from the repository with `.gitignore`.
- Removed the direct use of `navigation.navigate` from `onAuthStateChanged` within `LoginScreen`.

## 🧠 **Observations**
- The recommended Expo structure was used to maintain compatibility with `Expo Go`.
- Firebase v11 is working, but requires further attention for session persistence.

🛑 **Final Status:**  
The app compiles, navigates, and registers users with a balance, but presents unresolved navigation and session persistence errors.
