## üéØ **Goal**
Implement the Renta Fija screen, enabling users to select investment options (such as CDT, Propiedad Ra√≠z, Proyectos, Otros), choose a currency, and calculate investment in COP with conversion from USD.

## ‚úÖ **Tasks Completed**
- [x] Created `RentaFijaScreen` with a dynamic slider for investment categories: `CDT`, `Propiedad Ra√≠z`, `Proyectos`, `Otros`
- [x] Added a second slider inside `CDT` for selecting currency (USD, COP)
- [x] Integrated fixed exchange rates for USD to COP (1 USD = 4125 COP)
- [x] Created logic to convert the investment entered in COP to USD, checking if the user has enough USD balance
- [x] Updated Firestore to reflect the user's new investment in `saldoRentaFija` and deduct the equivalent in USD from `saldoTotal`
- [x] Added a confirmation dialog for the user before completing the investment
- [x] Created buttons for "Mis inversiones" and "Retirar ganancias"

## üßπ **Fixes**
- [x] Fixed type error with `curr` not being a valid index for `rendimientos` (used `Record<string, number>` for indexing)
- [x] Updated `RootStackParamList` to properly handle navigation to `Tabs` and inner screens (like `Inicio` and `Cuestionario`)
- [x] Fixed `useNavigation` error by ensuring correct typing with `NativeStackNavigationProp`

## üîê **Security Improvements**
- [x] Ensured Firestore rules properly restrict writing and reading user data based on authentication status
- [x] Used `increment` for updating `saldoTotal` and `saldoRentaFija` fields to ensure consistency in updates

## üìå **Decisions**
- The user will always input the investment amount in COP, while the user's balance remains in USD
- The USD to COP conversion is based on a fixed rate of 1 USD = 4125 COP for now, but an API for real-time rates can be integrated later
- The "Mis inversiones" and "Retirar ganancias" buttons are placeholders for future functionality
