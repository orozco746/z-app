# 🛠️ Development Log – 2025-08-14

## 🎯 Goal
Integrate real BTC candles into TradingScreen and prepare quiz logic for user decisions.

## ✅ Tasks Completed
- [x] Added fetch to Alpha Vantage API to retrieve 20 candles from previous day.
- [x] Updated TradingScreen to display real candles instead of static mock data.
- [x] Configured `.env` to securely store API key (`ALPHAVANTAGE_API_KEY`).
- [x] Adjusted TypeScript types to use `NativeStackNavigationProp<RootStackParamList>` to fix navigation type errors.
- [x] Retained quiz logic (Largo, Corto, Esperar, No operar) with Stop Loss and Take Profit inputs.
- [x] Added fallback message “Cargando velas...” while fetching data.

## 🧹 Fixes
- Resolved TS error: `navigation.navigate('Tabs', { screen: 'Inicio' })` by changing type to stack navigation.
- Removed old mock candle data after integration of real BTC candles.

## 📌 Decisions
- Use Alpha Vantage free API to get historical BTC intraday candles.
- Only fetch previous day candles (last 20) for quiz.
- Keep quiz logic ready to extend with TP/SL evaluation in future updates.
- Real-time dollar value conversion postponed for later feature implementation.
